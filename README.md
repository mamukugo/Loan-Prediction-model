# UNAM INSTITUTIONAL STUDENT LOAN REPAYEMENT CAPABILITY MODEL

## Objective

This  project aimed to establish the likelihood of a student to repay a loan should the university introduce institutional loans. By analyzing and collecting data based on various factors such as dregrees chosen , whether they had a job after graduating or not , their total tuition fees and various other factors. By collected data from past UNAM graduates , preprocessing this data and using the Decision Tree Classification model we were able to derive insights in enabling the university to make an informed decision on the implementation of these loans. 

### Skills Learned

- Data Collection and Mining : gathering and organizing real-world data.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting data outcomes.
- Python Programming : Enhanced profiency in Python , including libraries for data manipulation and analyisis(e.g Numpy , pandas)
- Data Visualization techniques and presenting data insights effectively.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel : to create CSV file
- Python , Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn , Matplotlib

## Steps


- Step 1: Establish Data Objectives - Goal of assesing student loan repayement capability.
- Step 2: Data collection - Gather real-world data on students.
- Step 3: Data Preprocessing - Clean and preprocess the data using Python.
- Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis -  Analyze and visulaize data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key factors .
- Step 5: Model Development - Implement a Decision Tree Classifier to predict repayment capabilities.
- Step 6: Model Evaluation - Asses models accuracy and performace using the accuracy score
- Step 7: The Deliverable - Document the process and present findings

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- One thing I noted for sure was that the accuracy score was 50%. Which is very low. In the future however this can be improved by collecting more input data and increasing the training and testing dataset which is used to train the model. And also with a larger data set The Random Forest Classification method can be used for a more accurate prediction.
