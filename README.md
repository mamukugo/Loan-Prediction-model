# UNAM INSTITUTIONAL STUDENT LOAN REPAYEMENT CAPABILITY MODEL

## Objective

This  project aimed to establish the likelihood of a student to repay a loan should the university introduce institutional loans. By analyzing and collecting data based on various factors such as dregrees chosen , whether they had a job after graduating or not , their total tuition fees and various other factors. By collected data from past UNAM graduates , preprocessing this data and using the Decision Tree Classification model we were able to derive insights in enabling the university to make an informed decision on the implementation of these loans. 

### Skills Learned

- Data Collection and Mining : gathering and organizing real-world data.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting data outcomes.
- Python Programming : Enhanced profiency in Python , including libraries for data manipulation and analyisis(e.g Numpy , pandas)
- Data Visualization techniques and presenting data insights effectively.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel : to create CSV file
- Python , Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn , Matplotlib
